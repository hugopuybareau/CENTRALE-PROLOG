# centrale_PROLOG_course

This repository gathers the 3 homeworks I completed during the 'Algorithme et raisonnement' course. 

The language is 'PROLOG', the reports, code and commentary are written in French.

The first work is about Family relation and creating predicates.
The second work is about Recipies and Book management and creating predicates.
The third work is about constraints and how to implement them using PROLOG.
